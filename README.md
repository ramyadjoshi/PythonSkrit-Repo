üîç About Sanskrit & Computational Linguistics
Sanskrit, one of the world's oldest languages, is renowned for its systematic grammar and mathematical precision. The language's structured nature makes it particularly suited for computational analysis and processing.
Why Sanskrit Computing?

Systematic Grammar: Panini's Ashtadhyayi provides rule-based grammar perfect for algorithms
Mathematical Structure: Sanskrit's logical construction aligns with programming principles
Digital Preservation: Technology helps preserve and analyze ancient texts
Educational Tools: Modern interfaces make Sanskrit learning accessible
Research Applications: Computational tools assist in linguistic research

Applications in Modern Context

Digital Humanities: Analyzing vast corpora of Sanskrit literature
Machine Translation: Developing Sanskrit-to-modern language translators
Educational Technology: Interactive learning tools for Sanskrit grammar
Text Processing: Automated analysis of classical texts
Linguistic Research: Computational approaches to historical linguistics

üöÄ Project Overview
PythonSkrit bridges the gap between ancient Sanskrit grammar and modern computational tools. Each application implements specific Sanskrit grammar rules using Python, providing both educational value and practical utility for Sanskrit processing tasks.
Design Philosophy

Rule-Based Implementation: Direct translation of Sanskrit grammar rules into code
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive GUI applications accessible to non-programmers
Educational Focus: Tools designed to teach Sanskrit grammar concepts
Accurate Processing: Faithful implementation of traditional grammar rules
Extensible Architecture: Easy to add new rules and features

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Included

Launch Application: Run the Python script
Input Text: Enter Sanskrit text in the provided fields
Process: Click the analyze/process button
Review Results: Examine the grammatical analysis and transformations

Input Formats Supported

IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration)
Harvard-Kyoto: ASCII representation of Sanskrit
Devanagari: Unicode Sanskrit script (limited support)

üìö Sanskrit Grammar Concepts
Sandhi (Euphonic Combinations)
Sandhi rules govern how sounds change when words combine in continuous speech:
Types Implemented:

Savarna Deergha Sandhi: Similar vowels combine to form long vowels

Example: deva + indra ‚Üí devendra


Guna Sandhi: Simple vowels combine with 'a' sounds

Example: deva + ish ‚Üí devesh


Vruddhi Sandhi: Complex vowel transformations

Example: maha + ish ‚Üí mahesh


Yan Sandhi: Semi-vowel insertions

Example: ati + anta ‚Üí atyanta


Yanadesha Sandhi: Vowel-to-diphthong transformations

Vrutta (Verse Meters)
Vrutta analysis involves identifying metrical patterns in Sanskrit poetry:
Meters Recognized:

Indravajra: Classical 11-syllable meter
Upendravajra: Variant of Indravajra
Vasanthatilaka: 14-syllable spring-themed meter
Malini: Complex 15-syllable pattern
Shardulavikriditam: Elaborate 19-syllable meter
Anushtup: Common 8-syllable sloka meter

Syllable Analysis:

Guru (Heavy): Long syllables or short syllables followed by consonant clusters
Laghu (Light): Short syllables in open positions

üß© Technical Implementation
Architecture Overview
Sandhi Processor
python# Rule-based processing system
def process_sandhi(word1, word2):
    # 1. Identify final and initial sounds
    # 2. Apply appropriate sandhi rules
    # 3. Return transformed combination
Vrutta Analyzer
python# Pattern matching system
def analyze_meter(shloka):
    # 1. Extract syllables
    # 2. Determine guru-laghu pattern
    # 3. Match against known meters
Data Structures
Vowel Classifications
python# Short vowels (hrasva)
hrs = ['a','i','u','q','L']

# Long vowels (dirgha)  
dgs = ['A','I','U','Q','e','E','o','O']

# All vowels (swara)
swr = hrs + dgs
Meter Patterns
python# Indravajra pattern (11 syllables)
indravajra = ['g','g','l','g','g','l','l','g','l','g','g']
